description: "I'm a mom and part-time creative. I love handmade gifts, and supporting independent and local business and I create handmade heirloom gifts bags and other items for thoughtful gifting. I also LOVE snail mail (part of the beauty of shopping online, and supporting Etsy makers around the world) and wanted to share that joy with my kids, so I created Petit Mail - story cards for preschoolers and early readers."
